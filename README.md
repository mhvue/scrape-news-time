## Technologies Used:

* Node.js
* Express
* Mongoose 
* MongoDB
* Axios
* Cheerio

## To Do
* Displaying Added Notes:
Still note quite ready. While it does add a note and a user can view the notes, there is glitch that the notes can duplicate or make few copies that is then displayed. By refreshing the page, it helps but does not solve the problem. Minor css still need as well for displaying purposes. 
* Scrape and Get not always workng togther
There is lag when click in Get Articles the servier is scraping and then will run ajax of GET to display.
