## To Do
* Displaying Added Notes<br>
Still note quite ready. While it does add a note and a user can view the notes, there is glitch causing the notes to duplicate or make a few copies tthe note, then it is displayed. By refreshing the page, it helps but does not solve the problem. Minor css still need as well for better displaying purposes. 
* Scrape and Get not workng togther<br>
There is lag when click in Get Articles. The servier is scraping and then will run ajax of GET to display but a second click is needed.
* Mobile Friendly<br>
While bootstrap helped, some minor issues need to fix to make application more mobile-friendly.
